Don't draw a shape and type text. Write your story, process or task first, then make shapes with the text automatically. It's just speedy and super simple.

1. Install [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/)

The flowmate is inspired by AEFlowchart. The concept is great and I use some codes he made. Thanks tadija!

The style of flowchart, espacially the decision symbol, is based on [Communicating Design 2nd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463) by Dan Brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion even he doesn't know me ;-)
