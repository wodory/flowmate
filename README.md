Modify `lib/options.js` if you wanna use your own options like shape/border colors and so on.

## To do

- [ ] Group and connect to/from group
- [ ] Smart align - to align Decision and other symbol
- [ ] Smart connect - really hard :-(
- [ ] Redraw connect - Redraw connectors if the shapes are moved
- [ ] Option dialog - Change shape/connector/border color and so on...

The style of flowchart, espacially the decision symbol, is based on [Communicating Design 2nd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463) by Dan Brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion even he doesn't know me ;-)
